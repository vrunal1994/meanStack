Step 1: Install an angular compiler: npm install -g @angular/compiler


Frontend:
Create a new application 
    ng new applicationName (frontend)

To begin running the application use:
    ng serve --open

Directory Structure:
    node_modules contains all the required dependences for the application
    node_modules/app holds the main application file
    application.component.html: holds the UI page
        use ng g c 'Component name' to create new components
        routing is for client side request handling to URL's
    application.module.ts: holds the controller for the webpage. Define all your routes, and dependency events here


Verification: 
Babel compiler is for realtime verification to changes,
